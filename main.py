# Welcome to the Poe server bot quick start. This repo includes starter code that allows you to
# quickly get a bot running. By default, the code uses the EchoBot, which is a simple bot that
# echos a message back at its user and is a good starting point for your bot, but you can
# comment/uncomment any of the following code to try out other example bots or build on top
# of the EchoBot.

from fastapi_poe import make_app
from modal import Image, Stub, asgi_app

from catbot import CatBot
from echobot import EchoBot
from huggingface_bot import HuggingFaceBot
from turbo_allcapsbot import GPT35TurboAllCapsBot
from turbo_vs_claude import GPT35TurbovsClaudeBot

# Echo bot is a very simple bot that just echoes back the user's last message.
bot = EchoBot()

# A sample bot that showcases the capabilities the protocol provides. Please see the
# following link for the full set of available message commands:
# https://github.com/poe-platform/server-bot-quick-start/blob/main/catbot/catbot.md
# bot = CatBot()

# A bot that uses Poe's GPT-3.5-Turbo bot, but makes all messages ALL CAPS.
# Good simple example of using another bot using Poe's bot query API.
# Please note that since this bot uses another Poe bot, you need to update this bot's settings on
# Poe by following the instructions at: https://developer.poe.com/server-bots/updating-bot-settings
# For more details, see: https://developer.poe.com/server-bots/accessing-other-bots-on-poe
# bot = GPT35TurboAllCapsBot()

# A bot that calls bot GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-instant and displays the results.
# Please note that since this bot uses another Poe bot, you need to update this bot's settings on
# Poe by following the instructions at: https://developer.poe.com/server-bots/updating-bot-settings
# For more details, see: https://developer.poe.com/server-bots/accessing-other-bots-on-poe
# bot = GPT35TurbovsClaudeBot()

# A chatbot based on a model hosted on HuggingFace.

    # Optionally, provide your Poe access key here:
    # 1. You can go to https://poe.com/create_bot?server=1 to generate an access key.
    # 2. We strongly recommend using a key for a production bot to prevent abuse,
    # but the starter example disables the key check for convenience.
    # 3. You can also store your access key on modal.com and retrieve it in this function
    # by following the instructions at: https://modal.com/docs/guide/secrets
